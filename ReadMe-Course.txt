For detecting device orientaition, we shoud install a library from react community, but this was also for 2020 when mosh course released
    npm install @react-native-community/hooks
    https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks

now the react native itself is evolved and no need to use community library
just use
import { useWindowDimensions } from "react-native";
